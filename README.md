# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom <br> Modification Repository
This is a collection of useful mods I am sharing with everyone so they can know which mods exist and easily install in an organized manner. All mods are seperate and named to provide an abundance of information at a glance.

# Purpose
Provide users with an easy method to select which essential mods they want to use. The mods are broken into eight categories.  
- **Essential:** Mods that I consider to be essential in enhancing graphics. User may pick any and/or all mods here. 
- **Resolution:** Native resolution. Modes are: 1280x720, 1440x810, 1792x1008, 1920x1080. Only one mod should be selected. Users with a 1440p screen should be fine with 1008p and 2x Internal Resolution in the emulator.
- **FPS:** The maximum framerate. Modes are: 20 FPS, 30 FPS, or 60 FPS. Only one mod should be selected. Used in conjunction with Dynamic FPS from Essential mods. Without it, gameplay will slowdown when FPS drops.
- **Shadows:** Modes are: 256x256, 512x512, and 1024x1024 resolution. Only one mod should be selected.  
- **Controller & Black Screen Fix:** Controller mods come with black screen fix, or black screen fix can be selected alone. Only one mod should be selected. Alternatively, go use the [Any Aspect Ratio](https://github.com/fayaz12g/totk-aar) tool to create your own aspect ratio, controller mod, with black screen fix.
- **Fog:** Options to minimize or disable fog. Only one mod should be selected, unless using Serfrost's Defogger which may be combined with an interior addon. This is optional, and other fog mods already include interior fog so don't combine them.
- **Other Mods:** Mods to enhance gameplay or make things faster. All of these are mods are completely optional.  
- **Cheats:** Game too hard or you aren't having fun? Some cheats might liven things up. All cheats are obviously optional. AFAIK, they are in a Yuzu compatible format and won't work with Ryujinx. Go [here](https://github.com/bad1dea/NXCheats/tree/main/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tears%20of%20the%20Kingdom) for Ryujinx.

# Downloading
- Click the green **Code** button, and click **Download Zip**. There will be no "releases" of this collection.

# Information
- A simplified modpack that includes what I consider to be the essential mods offered in an organized manner.
- Links to all mods, their creator, and their licenses are provided with this collection.
- Most "romfs" mods are licensed under "CC BY-NC-ND 4.0", which allows sharing them in any medium or format. 
- The restictions are that credit must be given, a link to the license included, and changes be made aware of. 
- The mods covered under this license can not be sold for profit, and no derivatives can be created from them. 
- This pack makes no attempt to modify the mods, but redistribute them in a way that complies with their licenses.
- An argument could be made that including them in a "modpack" could qualify this as a "remix". The counter argument to this is that several other modpacks and various places on the internet also include the majority of the mods here, and its not a modpack that the user can just extract and install with a drag and drop. All mods are provided in their original form: no modifications by me.  
- This collection is not a work that attempts to create a new work, each mod stands on their own and are not dependent on and may conflict with other mods. Conscious choice needs to be made on what mods are selected by the user. The included [ReadMe](https://github.com/BigheadSMZ/TotKMods/blob/main/Mods/ReadMe%20-%20Credits%2C%20Info%2C%20License.txt) contains what files each romfs mod modifies.
- With all that said, if a mod creator does not wish to have their mods included, I will remove them from future packs and instead just provide users with a link to the mod in their place IF I find their argument reasonable. Something like "I don't want my mod in there because I don't like you" or "this just creates confusion or competition" is not a good reason to deprive users of choice. While removing mods would be less convenient for everyone, I intend to comply with the authors and their respective mods and licenses.
- With all that legalese out of the way, I hope this is useful to you, the user who has downloaded this modpack.

# Aspect Ratio Mods
- I am not supplying Aspect Ratio mods as there is a fantastic tool by [fayaz12g](https://github.com/fayaz12g) to generate a mod using your preferred aspect ratio, a controller mod, and a black screen fix. That tool is called [Any Aspect Ratio](https://github.com/fayaz12g/totk-aar) and can be used as an alternative to the controller/black screen fix mods found here, on gamebanana, or anywhere else. Currently modifying aspect ratios can be complicating due to several romfs mods all attempting to edit the same files. This tool easily solves that problem by editing them all at once!

# Notice
- I do not create these mods, I am merely offering them in a way that is simple for the user to make use of.
- If you have any issues with the mods, I suggest notifying their respective creator and alerting them of the issue.  
- I will not be releasing "versions" of this collection. The pack will contain whatever is offered and downloaded at the time of downloading. Mods can be downloaded independently through navigating this repository or by downloading the entire collection via the green "Code" button as a ZIP file.
- While I will accept issues and pull requests, they should only be made to alert me of or commit updated mods. I do not promise I will be actively updating this repository but I will try to at least keep it somewhat updated.
- I highly encourage checking the links in the **Credits** section as the authors of the mods may have more up-to-date versions than what is provided here. It's also a good way to engage with the creators and offer support.
- This pack was not made to compete with existing modpacks such as the pack by HolographicWings or the collection by Jazzverso, but provide an alternative for those that wish to have complete control over their mods by keeping each module separate. This modpack also prefers to provide exefs versions of mods over romfs versions if possible to avoid the potential for mod conflicts.
