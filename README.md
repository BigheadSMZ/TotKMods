# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom <br> Independent Modification Repository
This is a collection of mods that I find useful that I am sharing with everyone so they can know which mods exist and easily install them in an organized manner.

# Purpose
Provide users with an easy method to select which essential mods they want to use. The mods are broken into eight categories.
00. Essential: Mods that I consider to be essential in enhancing graphics. All mods can be used or no mods can be used. User selects which ones they want.
01. Resolution: The native rendering resolution. Modes are: 1280x720, 1440x810, 1792x1008, 1920x1080. Only one mod should be selected.
02. FPS: The maximum framerate. Modes are: 20 FPS, 30 FPS, or 60 FPS. Only one mod should be selected. Used in conjunction with Dynamic FPS from Essential mods.
03. Shadows: The resolution of shadows. Modes are: 256x256, 512x512, and 1024x1024. Only one mod should be selected.
04. Controller & Black Screen Fix: Controller mods come with black screen fix, or black screen fix can be selected independently. Only one mod should be selected.
05. Fog: Options to enhance fog, minimize fog, and disable fog. Only one mod should be selected, unless using Serfrost which may be combined with an interior addon.
06. Other Mods: Optional mods to enhance gameplay or make things faster. All of these are optional and do not need to be used.
07. Cheats: Game too hard or you aren't having fun? Some cheats might liven things up. All cheats are obviously optional.

# Downloading
- Click the green **Code** button, and click **Download Zip**.

# Information
- A simplified modpack that includes what I consider to be the essential mods offered in an organized manner.
- Most "romfs" mods are licensed under "CC BY-NC-ND 4.0", which allows sharing the material in any medium or format. 
- The restictions are that credit must be given, a link to the license must be included, and changes must be made aware. 
- The mods covered under this license can not be sold for profit, and no derivatives can be created from them. 
- This pack makes no attempt to modify the mods, but redistribute them in a way that complies with their licenses.
- An argument could be made that including them in a "modpack" could qualify this as a "remix". The counter argument to this is that its not a pack that the user can just extract and install. It's not a work that attempts to create a new work, each mod stands on their own and may conflict with other mods. Conscious choice needs to be made on what mods are selected by the user.
- Links to all mods, their creator, and their licenses are provided.
- With all that said, if a mod creator does not wish to have their mods included, I will remove them from future packs and instead just provide users with a link to the mod in their place IF I find their argument reasonable. Something like "I don't want my mod in there because I don't like you" or "this just creates confusion or competition" is not a good reason to deprive users of choice. While removing mods would be less convenient for everyone, I intend to comply with the authors and their respective mods and licenses.
- With all that legalese out of the way, I hope this is useful to you, the user who has downloaded this modpack.

# Notice
- I do not create these mods, I am merely offering them in a way that is simple for the user to make use of. Take any issues with the mods themselves to their respective creators.
- I will not be releasing "versions" of this collection, WYSIWYG. They can be downloaded independently through navigating this repository or by downloading the "code" as a "zip".
- While I will accept issues and pull requests, they should only be made to alert me of or commit updated mods. I do not promise I will be actively updating this repository but I will try.
- I highly encourage checking the links in the **Credits** section as the authors of the mods may have more up-to-date versions than what is provided here.
- This pack was not made to compete with existing modpacks such as the pack by HolographicWings or the collection by Jazzverso, but provide an alternative for those that wish to have complete control over their mods by keeping each module separate. This modpack also prefers to provide exefs versions of mods over romfs versions if possible to avoid the potential for mod conflicts.
